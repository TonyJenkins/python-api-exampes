Three simple programs that use Web APIs.

* ``dollar.py`` Uses http://fixer.io/ to find the pount/dollar exchange rate.
* ``location.py`` uses http://ipinfo.io/ to get an approximate location for the user.
* ``weather.py`` uses https://www.wunderground.com/ to find the user's weather, based on their IP.
